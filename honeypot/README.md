# A Simple PHP Honeypot
Notes on convering a Wordpress install into a honeypot system.  
Wordpress uses the "wp-load.php" files to bootstrap. Hooking here is  
a simple way to log GET/POST requests.

## base.php
This php script logs all HTTP requests ( GET/POST/HEAD/etc ) into the  
appropriate log files. Each line is a JSON entry. Files names are created  
based on the day. 

It captures:

* Request parameters
* HTTP Headers
* IP Address
* Timestamp

It uses its own getallheaders() function, as some installations might not  
have it.

## Installing 
* Put base.php in the Wordpress installation directory. 
* Create a "logs" directory ( change $logdir in base.php accordingly )
* Insert the following line into "wp-load.php":
    + require( dirname(__FILE__) . '/base.php' );

## Dependencies

Will update

## Notes
* "wp-load.php" is loaded by almost any Wordpress PHP file. So, add base.php here.
* Similar setup should work for Joomla/others too
